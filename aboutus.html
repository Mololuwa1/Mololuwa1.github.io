            <h4 class="dr-dk"> About Dr D.K Olukoya</h4>
            <img class="g-o" src="images/dkoo.jpeg" alt="general overseer">
            <p>Dr. Daniel Kolawole Olukoya (DKO) was born in Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria to Mr. Olukoya, a Police officer and Mrs. Olukoya, a trader.

                While registered at St. John’s CAC Primary School, Akure, he was recognized as an exceptionally intelligent child coming tops throughout his stay at the school. 
                
                Later when his family moved to Lagos, he was enrolled at St. Jude’s Primary school, Ebute metta from which he graduated with excellent results.
                
                DKO then proceeded to Methodist Boys’ High School (MBHS), Broad Street, Lagos (established in 1878). Incidentally, this is where he became born again. </p> 
                
               <p> It was also at MBHS that he encountered an Indian teacher who once said in class
                
                 “Boys, if you want to escape poverty, READ YOUR BOOK!” DKO doggedly followed this advice, studying from 9pm to 3am daily. 
                
                By the time DKO finished from MBHS, he was the best graduating student of his set.</p>
                
                <p> In 1976, DKO was admitted into the University of Lagos (Unilag) to study Microbiology. 
                
                He graduated from Unilag in 1980 with a first-class degree in Microbiology. He was the first person to have achieved a first-class
                
                 in the course at the university and his G.P.A is still the highest recorded so far (as at February 2010) in that course.
                
                Soon after graduation, DKO won a scholarship to study for a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in Molecular Genetics at the University of Reading, United Kingdom.</p> 
                
               <p>Despite the natural difficulty of the programme, DKO earned his PhD in 3 years and returned to Nigeria.
                
                Upon his return to Nigeria, DKO joined the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), Yaba, where his 
                
                reputation as an exceptional Geneticist of African origin became established. 
                
                DKO emerged as an authority in the study of genetics, publishing over 70 scientific papers in a short span (a remarkable feat by any standard). 
                
                He also taught Genetics and was external examiner in a number of universities. Moreover, he has attended and presented papers at
                
                 scientific conferences in almost all continents of the world.
                
                Even today, DKO continues to contribute to the field of genetics and biotechnology via the 
                
                Daniel & Fola Biotechnology Foundation, a registered NGO established to empower Nigerian citizens with modern and contemporary laboratory
                
                 skills in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology.  </p> 
                
                <p> DKO’s father, apart from being a policeman, was also a pastor at the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC). 
                
                Thus, he was raised in a Christian home with Christian beliefs. Throughout all his years in school, DKO was committed to the service of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
                
                His passion for Jesus and his spiritual fire increased tremendously during his doctorate degree in the United Kingdom. 
                
                DKO’s ministry is heavily influenced by the work of the late Apostle Joseph Ayodele Babalola, the founder of the CAC church. </p>
                
               <p>In the dedication pages of the Prayer Rain and Prayer Passport books, DKO writes of Apostle Babalola:
                
                “Apostle Joseph Ayodele Babalola was a minister of God who understood the power of prayer. 
                
                He was a man mightily used by God to ignite the fire of the first Christian revival in Nigeria in the 1930s. Brother J.A. and his team of aggressive prayer
                
                 warriors entered forbidden forests, silenced demons that demanded worship and paralysed deeply rooted, anti-gospel activities. 
                
                Sometimes, beginning from the highest places, they openly disgraced satanic agents, emptied hospitals by the healing power of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
                
                rendered witchdoctors jobless, and they started the first indigenous Holy Ghost filled church in Nigeria.</p> 
                
                <p>So far – and we stand to be corrected – none has equalled, let alone surpassed this humble brother in the field of aggressive evangelism in this country.”
                
                The works of Dr. Daniel Olukoya are published by the Battle Cry Christian Ministries. 
                
                These published works include over 250 life-changing Christian books (as at July 2015), audio tapes and CDs, video discs and many more.</p>

            <h4 class="abm">About MFM Ministry</h4>
            <p>
                MFM Ministries is a full gospel ministry devoted to the Revival of Apostolic Signs, Holy Ghost fireworks and the unlimited demonstration of the power of God to deliver to the uttermost.
                Absolute holiness within and without as the greatest spiritual insecticide and a pre-requisite for Heaven is taught openly. MFM is a do-it-yourself Gospel ministry where your hands are trained to wage war and your fingers to do battle.
                At MFM, aggressive prayer is considered as an aid to spiritual focus and a check against being overwhelmed by the flesh. At MFM Prayer City, prayer goes on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, non-stop.

            <h5 class="itb">In the beginning</h5>
            <p>
                Soon after completing his Ph.D. in the United Kingdom, and while working at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Dr. Daniel Kolawole Olukoya (DKO) summoned a prayer meeting. This was on a Wednesday in 1989. 24 brethren showed up at the meeting. The venue of that meeting was in the living room of DKO.</p>
             <p> After that meeting, the voice of providence kept calling for subsequent meetings. At these meetings, the power of God came down and verifiable miracles began to happen in the lives of the attending brethren. The power of God began to evangelise the prayer meetings and a spiritual explosion began with people coming from far and wide to seek the face of God.</p>
               <p> With more and more people attending the prayer meetings, a larger location was required. The prayer meetings moved to 60 Old Yaba Road, Yaba, Lagos. Here, the teeming crowd of believers grew in even more amazing proportion necessitating yet another relocation.</p>
              <p>  The prayer group was offered and purchased an abandoned slum located at 13 Olasimbo Street, Onike, Yaba. It was a fairly large piece of land near the second gate of the University of Lagos. That slum has now been transformed into the International Headquarters of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries of which Dr. Olukoya is the General Overseer. The name "Mountain of Fire & Miracles Ministries" was revealed to DKO during normal prayer and the church had its first service on April 24, 1994.</p>
              <p>  Even at the new location, believers and those seeking help kept coming leading to a very large congregation. This situation posed a challenge of crowd, growth and expansion management to the leadership of the church. Thus, under the direction of the Lord, MFM evolved a strategy of a network of branches in every state capital, local government headquarters, senatorial district and locality. Till this day and across the world, MFM branches spring up as one of the fastest growing churches of this generation. International church branches first started in London before spreading to the United States, Canada, the rest of Europe, the Caribbean, Africa and Asia. On every continent, MFM is profoundly visible and greatly impactful.

                    What is an end-time church? An end-time church is a church where a sinner enters with two options: he either repents or does not come back, contrary to the present day church where sinners are comfortable and find things so easy and convenient</li>

                <li>To build up heavenly-bound and aggressive Christians. The priority in MFM is for people to make heaven. It is not a worldly Church</li>
